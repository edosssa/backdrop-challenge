This repository contains code for the Backdrop coding challenge.

## What's inside âœ¨

- Fully functional GraphQL server as per the challenge requirements
- Integration tests using Mocha, Chai and supertest
- Continuous integration (CI) using Github actions
- 100% Typescript, because it's not 2005 anymore

## Getting started

```bash
cd <project-dir>
yarn
yarn start # or yarn dev
```

## TL;DR
### Mutation vs Query
The challenge requirements specify that the GraphQL server have a single ```shortenURL``` **query**. However, I feel as per the GraphQL [specification](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Mutation) it could be better implemented as a **mutation** instead because it modifies server resources akin to a http POST.

### Schema first vs Code first
For this challenge I decided to use the schema-first approach to show that I can write out the GraphQL SDL by hand and also because the requirements are fairly small and straightforward; for bigger projects however, I'm more inclined to use the code-first approach leveraging frameworks like [Nexus](https://nexusjs.org) and [TypeQL](https://typeql.com/).

>PS: I do hope I'm considered for the role.
